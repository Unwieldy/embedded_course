# Write to stdout and read from stdin

## Task
Write a program that writes text to stdout, and reads text from stdin.
To test the program use a serial terminal on your computer eg. minicom.

Try to write the code yourself! Do not look at the example code unless you are stuck.

## Tips
You will have to ensure that stdin and stdout is passed over USB to your computer. This can be configured in your CMakeLists.txt.
