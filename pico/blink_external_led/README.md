# A simple example of blink

## Task
Write a program for your Pico that blinks an external led.
If you need help with connecting your led you can look at the schematic in the ref folder.

Try to write the code yourself! Do not look at the example code unless you are stuck.

## Tips
You will probably need to use the folloing funtions from the pico sdk:

* [gpio_init](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/pico-sdk/hardware.html#group_hardware_gpio_1ga8aa4741d93dc40bc728dbd3e41813ad1)
* [gpio_set_dir](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/pico-sdk/hardware.html#group_hardware_gpio_1ga6a40edf0d86f6b3f0dcb51a768cf4681)
* [gpio_put](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/pico-sdk/hardware.html#group_hardware_gpio_1ga71d35b29e897b9bb4fc881b587b08cab)
